# hello-world

Hello!

I'm finally learning to code. I learned a bit of HTML in 1999-2000, but since then everything has changed, and clearly gotten more complicated! I'm starting with FreeCodeCamp to learn some things, and we'll see where things go from there. It's April 2018, and I've just moved from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.
